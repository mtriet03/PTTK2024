## Information System Analysis and Design Project
We followed a structured **Information System Analysis & Design** process, covering:
- **Requirements Analysis** – Identified system needs and security objectives.
- **Business Use-Case Modeling** – Defined system interactions and workflows.
- **Relational Data Model** – Designed a secure **Oracle Database schema**.
- **Behavioral & Structural Modeling** – Created **activity diagrams, sequence diagrams, and class diagrams**.
- **User Interface Design** – Developed a **Windows Forms UI** for user interactions.
- **Security Implementation** – Applied **fine-grained access control, encryption, and auditing**.
- **3-Layer Architecture** – Used a structured **Presentation Layer, Business Logic Layer, and Data Access Layer** for maintainability.
